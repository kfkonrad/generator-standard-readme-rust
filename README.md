Generate Standard Readme-compatible READMEs

Standard Readme is a standard style for writing READMEs created by [@RichardLitt](https://github.com/RichardLitt). He
himself had implemented a Yeoman generator for creating standardized READMEs just like this one. This tool is
heavily inspired by [Richard's generator](https://github.com/RichardLitt/generator-standard-readme). I just wanted to
write an implementation that can be distributed as a single statically linked binary. This implementation supports every
feature the original one does and should generate near-identical READMEs.

See [the Standard Readme repo](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme) for more information on Standard Readmes.
